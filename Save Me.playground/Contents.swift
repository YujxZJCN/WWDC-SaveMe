 **Welcome To Space!**
 
 Today is June 3, 2050. And my name is Earth.
 
 For some reason, the sun's gravity suddenly increases. And he has turned into a demon.👿

 All stars in the Solar System are completely controlled by him and so do I.
 
 **I need your help!🆘**
 
 Help me escape from the Solar System and help all humankind survive!
